Welcome to PitchPerfex. In this game, we have a few modes: Piano, Easy, Medium, Hard, Survival Modes. This game also has a Konami Code for the purpose of debugging. Now let's get started.
First up: The Piano Mode. This piano mode allows the user to play a normal keyboard with 8 notes: c,d,e,f,g,a,b,C. You can play for an unlimited amount of time until you decide to return to the main menu.
