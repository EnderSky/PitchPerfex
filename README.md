                                                        ~PITCHPERFEX~

Welcome to PitchPerfex. In this game, we have a few modes: Piano, Easy, Medium, Hard, Survival Modes. This game also has a Konami Code for the purpose of debugging. Now let's get started.
First up: The Piano Mode. This piano mode allows the user to play a normal keyboard with 8 notes: c,d,e,f,g,a,b,C. You can play for an unlimited amount of time until you decide to return to the main menu.
Now the Modes of Different Difficulty. You will be presented with a tune containing a certain number of notes based on your difficulty level. You have to listen carefully, following which pressing the corresponding button to that note. If you get it correct, an ascending tune will be played. If not, a descending tune will be played. This will go on until you exit to the menu.
Easy mode will contain 3 notes, Medium mode will contain 5 notes, while Hard mode will contain 8 notes.
Survival Mode. This mode is interesting. You will first be presented with a tune consisting of only one note. If you pass that level, you will be promoted to the next level. Each level contains 3 parts: .1, .2, .3. Each part contains a different tune, but containing the same number of notes. If you pass the level, you will ascend to the next level, which will now contain one more note, and so on. Everytime you lose, you will drop a part. If you drop sufficient parts, you will downgrade to the previous level. This will result in the loss of one life. You have 3 lives total. If you lose all your lives, you will lose the game and your score will be recorded.
Last but not least is the Konami Code. You have to enter a certain code to access it. This is for debugging purposes.
